## Welcome to Akash Rodhiya's Webpage
My work focuses on Combustion Concepts that are relevent to low emissions, high efficiency and fuel flexibility of stationary gas turbines for power generation. I study the auto-ignition control mode using massively parallel Direct Numerical Simulations. These simulations generate huge data. So, I use different analyzing and visualization techniques to understand the flow physics.

Apart from research, I am very much interested in sports. I like to play Football, Badminton and Cricket
in particular, but I am up for any sports. I also like adventures sports like trekking and adventure camps.
