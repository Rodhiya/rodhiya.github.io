## About me
---
I am M-Tech (Research) student under [Dr. Konduri Aditya](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/konduriadi/) in FLAME lab. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi in 2019 with GPA 8.01. In the same year, I joined Department of Computational and Data Sciences at Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. 

My work focuses on Combustion Concepts that are relevent to low emissions, high efficiency and fuel flexibility of stationary gas turbines for power generation. I study the auto-ignition control mode using massively parallel Direct Numerical Simulations. These simulations generate huge data. So, I use different analyzing and visualization techniques to understand the flow physics.

Apart from research, I am very much interested in sports. I like to play Football, Badminton and Cricket in particular, but I am up for any sports. I also like adventure outings like trekking and adventure camps.

Interests:
- Fluid Mechanics
- Combustion
- Turbulence
- Scientific Computing

## Current Projects

### Pressure scaling of reheat flame structure
In this work, we are doing direct numerical simulations at different pressure levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) to understand pressure scaling of reheat flame structure. And also quantify the distribution of fractional fuel consumption rate on different modes of combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA). I have presented this work in the conference American Physical Society- Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS-DFD).

### Research methods (DS200)
Main objective of this work is to get familiar with plotting and analyzing real life data using tools in matplotlib. For this, I have used data of 'Primary Energy Consumption in Select Countries of the World from 2012 to 2018' from [data.gov.in](data.gov.in) and represented it by different plots. Link to this project is [here](https://github.com/Rodhiya/DS200)

## Past Projects

### Thermal Energy storage Battery using Phase Change Material
Battery storage of thermal energy was designed using phase change material. Simulations were performed on STAR CCM+ to compare different heat exchangers and final designed was analyzed using self developed experiment setup. 


### Designing of vapor chamber and heat sink for air cooling of laser
Vapor chamber with given dimension constraints and heat flux was designed with the thorough literature review. Along with this, Heat sink was designed with pin fin. Other configuration with rectangular fin was also considered but it was not efficient as per the requirement.


### Gym Powered RO purifier
Reverse osmosis water purified was developed which was powered from a gym equipment (cycle for this project). Most of the parts were used from existing RO purifier exploiting interchangeability.
