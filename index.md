## About me
---
I am a Doctoral candidate under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/katepalli-sreenivasan" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. K. R. Sreenivasan</a> at Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Tandon School of Engineering, New York University. I completed my M Tech (Research) in Computational Science from Dept. of Computational and Data Sciences, IISc Bangalore, India.

<p>I am studying the governing laws of turbulent kinetic energy and length scales for the Decaying Turbulence. We are performing a massively parallel Direct Numerical Simulation of a three-dimensional periodic box. We are in the direction of simulating Decaying turbulence at the highest possible Reynolds number for a considerable flow time duration to analyze a complete picture of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Apart from research, I am very much interested in sports. I like to play Football, Badminton and Cricket in particular, but I enjoy exploring any sports. I also like adventure activities such as trekking and camps.</p>

Interests:
- Fluid Mechanics
- Combustion
- Turbulence
- Scientific Computing

## Current Projects

### Scaling of turbulent flow dynamics with mean magnetic field
Turbulence is a multi-scale phenomena and it exhibit non-linear transfer of energy between different length scales. The cascade of energy result in energy spectra with interesting properties. Main focus of this project to study the scaling of the energy cascade with the different level of mean magnetic fields. It expected to have steeper slope in the energy spectra due to increase dissipation by the presence of magnetic field. But the mentioned hypothesis is yet to confirm.

### Effect of fuel-blend ratio in methane-hydrogen reheat flames 
It is hard to use pure hydrogen fuel in current state of the art gas turbine without any compromises. Through this work, we are trying to understand how combustion characterstics transitions with different blending ratios of CH4-H2-air with the help of 2D simulations of reheat burner at 5 bar. Three fuel blends comprised of CH4 and H2 at a ratio 0.5:0.5, 0.3:0.7 and 0:1 by volume are considered. Abstract of this work has been submitted to 74th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics.

### Pressure scaling of reheat flame structure
In this work, we are doing direct numerical simulations at different pressure levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) to understand pressure scaling of reheat flame structure. And also quantify the distribution of fractional fuel consumption rate on different modes of combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA). I have presented this work in the conference American Physical Society- Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS-DFD).

## Past Projects

### Thermal Energy storage Battery using Phase Change Material
Battery storage of thermal energy was designed using phase change material. Simulations were performed on STAR CCM+ to compare different heat exchangers and final designed was analyzed using self developed experiment setup. 


### Designing of vapor chamber and heat sink for air cooling of laser
Vapor chamber with given dimension constraints and heat flux was designed with the thorough literature review. Along with this, Heat sink was designed with pin fin. Other configuration with rectangular fin was also considered but it was not efficient as per the requirement.


### Gym Powered RO purifier
Reverse osmosis water purified was developed which was powered from a gym equipment (cycle for this project). Most of the parts were used from existing RO purifier exploiting interchangeability.
