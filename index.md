## About me
---
I am Senior Research Fellow under the supervison of [Prof. Mahendra Kumar Verma](https://sites.google.com/view/mahendra-verma/) at Dept. of Physics, IIT Kanpur. I recently completed my M Tech (Research) in Computational Science from Dept. of Computational and Data Sciences, IISc Bangalore with GPA 9.3/10. 

My work focuses at IITK focuses on energy transfer between different length scales relevant to Magneto-hydrodynaamics. I am performing peroidic box simulations to study the scaling with different level of mean magnetic field. We uses psuedo-spectral code which is parallised on GPU to perform the simulations. Before that, I was studying the combustion characterics relvant to stationary gas turbines for power generation at IISc Bangalore. For which, I performed the massively parallel Direct Numerical Simulations to study the scaling with the pressure and methane blending.

Apart from research, I am very much interested in sports. I like to play Football, Badminton and Cricket in particular, but I am up for any sports. I also like adventure outings like trekking and adventure camps.

Interests:
- Fluid Mechanics
- Combustion
- Turbulence
- Scientific Computing

## Current Projects

### Effect of fuel-blend ratio in methane-hydrogen reheat flames 
It is hard to use pure hydrogen fuel in current state of the art gas turbine without any compromises. Through this work, we are trying to understand how combustion characterstics transitions with different blending ratios of CH4-H2-air with the help of 2D simulations of reheat burner at 5 bar. Three fuel blends comprised of CH4 and H2 at a ratio 0.5:0.5, 0.3:0.7 and 0:1 by volume are considered. Abstract of this work has been submitted to 74th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics.

### Pressure scaling of reheat flame structure
In this work, we are doing direct numerical simulations at different pressure levels (1, 5 and 10 bar) to understand pressure scaling of reheat flame structure. And also quantify the distribution of fractional fuel consumption rate on different modes of combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA). I have presented this work in the conference American Physical Society- Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS-DFD).

## Past Projects

### Thermal Energy storage Battery using Phase Change Material
Battery storage of thermal energy was designed using phase change material. Simulations were performed on STAR CCM+ to compare different heat exchangers and final designed was analyzed using self developed experiment setup. 


### Designing of vapor chamber and heat sink for air cooling of laser
Vapor chamber with given dimension constraints and heat flux was designed with the thorough literature review. Along with this, Heat sink was designed with pin fin. Other configuration with rectangular fin was also considered but it was not efficient as per the requirement.


### Gym Powered RO purifier
Reverse osmosis water purified was developed which was powered from a gym equipment (cycle for this project). Most of the parts were used from existing RO purifier exploiting interchangeability.
